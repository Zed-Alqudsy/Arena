# üß≠ XGAMES RUN THREAD KICKOFF GUIDE

### Purpose
This document is used at the start of every new XGAMES thread to ensure no loss of context, consistent execution, and stable memory across threads.

---

## ü™ú 1Ô∏è‚É£ THREAD INIT TEMPLATE

Copy and paste this block into your first message in each new thread:

```
[THREAD INIT]
Load both uploaded docs as system reference:
1) XGAMES_RUN_SYSTEM_MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md
2) XGAMES_COMPETITION_SETUP_DEEP_DIVE.md

Objective (today): <one specific step, e.g. "Build Run Home Page">

Constraints:
- Do NOT change storage key names (CID/EID/HEAT).
- Read-only pages must not modify arena_competitions_setup.
- If a new data key or contract is needed, propose it first and update the blueprints before coding.

Deliverables:
- What changed (summary)
- Where to paste (file + exact line)
- Keys read/written
- 3 test steps to verify in browser
[/THREAD INIT]
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ ONE-STEP PIPELINE

- Only one deliverable per session.  
- GPT provides: **exact paste**, **read/write keys**, **3 verification steps**.  
- Confirm working ‚Üí move to next step.

## üîí 3Ô∏è‚É£ DON'T BREAK LIST (Core Data Contracts)

| Type | Key / Example | Rule |
|------|----------------|------|
| Competition | `competitions_active` | Approved competitions only |
| Events | `events_<CID>` | Event metadata per competition |
| Heats | `heats_<CID>_<EID>` | Each event's heats |
| Judges | `judges_<CID>` | Panel setup |
| Athletes | `athletes_<CID>` | Registered participants |
| Scoring | `scoring_<CID>` | Criteria array (added on Approve) |
| Scores | `scores_<CID>_<EID>_<HEAT>` | Judge input results |
| Active Heat | `active_heat` | `{ cid, eid, heat }` currently running |
| Display | `display_<CID>` | Live display config |

üö´ Never modify `arena_competitions_setup` outside Setup.  
Only `setup_new.html` writes to it.

## ‚úÖ 4Ô∏è‚É£ DEFINITION OF DONE (Per Task)

| Area | Must Prove |
|------|-------------|
| Data | Page shows correct values from correct keys |
| Safety | No new keys introduced silently |
| Testing | 3-step test passes (browser) |
| Docs | Changes logged in blueprint or changelog section |

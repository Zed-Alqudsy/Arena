## **Batch 3 – Operational Modules (Phase 1 Extended Audit)**

### 🧩 Overview
This batch defines the interaction layer across **athlete registration**, **federation approval**, **event administration**, and **judge scoring**. Together with the Run Console, these pages complete the offline end-to-end competition workflow.

---

### 1️⃣ Athlete Center
**File:** `athlete_center.html`【50†source】
- **Purpose:** Athlete-facing dashboard.
- **UI:** 3 Cards → Register, Join, My Entries.
- **Logic:** Simple navigation links to athlete module pages.
- **Status:** ✅ Functional placeholder.
- **Next:** Integrate NSID registry and connect to `State.keys.athletes`.

---

### 2️⃣ Federation Center
**File:** `federation_center.html`【52†source】
- **Purpose:** Federation admin for athlete & entry approval.
- **Logic:** Reads from `State.keys.athletesMaster` and `State.keys.entriesStaging(cid)`; displays counts as badges.
- **UI:** 3 Cards → Approve Athletes, Approve Entries, Competition Center.
- **Status:** ✅ Functional UI.
- **Next:** Add approval logic + federation authentication.

---

### 3️⃣ Event Admin
**File:** `event_admin.html`【51†source】
- **Purpose:** Event-level control dashboard before heat selection.
- **Logic:** Reads `cid` and `eid` parameters; loads event info from `State.keys.events(cid)`; links to `heat_select.html`.
- **Status:** ✅ Stable.
- **Next:** Add editable metadata (rounds, schedule, divisions).

---

### 4️⃣ Heat Select
**File:** `heat_select.html`【53†source】
- **Purpose:** Heat selector bridging Event Admin → Run Console.
- **Logic:** Reads from `State.keys.heats(cid,eid)`; builds card list with buttons to open `run_console.html`.
- **Fallback:** Creates placeholder heats if none exist.
- **Status:** ✅ Functional offline.
- **Next:** Integrate heat creation + status updates.

---

### 5️⃣ Judge Console
**File:** `judge.html`【54†source】
- **Purpose:** Judge scoring interface for real-time evaluation.
- **UI:** Dark header mast with timer, judge & athlete tags, and score inputs.
- **Dynamic Criteria:** Loaded from `scoring_<cid>`; builds weighted scoring fields automatically.
- **Core Logic:**
  ```js
  const pkt = {
    type:'judge_status', cid, eid, heat,
    judgeId:jid, athleteId:aid,
    scores, total, status:'locked'
  };
  localStorage.setItem('judge_status', JSON.stringify(pkt));
  localStorage.setItem('judge_status_tick', String(Date.now()));
  ```
  Broadcasts judge score packet for Run Console pickup.
- **Status:** ✅ Functional local mode.
- **Next:**
  - Add real-time sync to Run Console.
  - Implement judge authentication.
  - Extend criteria templates per sport/discipline.

| Layer | Completion | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Athlete Registration | ⚙️ Prototype | Register/Join pages missing backend. |
| Federation Approval | ⚙️ Partial | Counts shown, logic pending. |
| Event Admin → Heat → Run | ✅ End-to-end local flow | Fully offline-capable. |
| Judge Scoring | ✅ Robust | Weighted, validated, time-tracked. |
| Cloud Integration | ❌ Pending | Firestore/API not yet implemented. |
| Multi-user Roles | ❌ Pending | Needs federation/judge auth system. |

## 🏛 L1 — FEDERATION SAAS LAYER

**Goal:** Make platform appear multi-federation SaaS-ready.

### Tasks
1. 🔐 Hardcode federation login (email/password).  
2. 🧱 Build `/federation/dashboard.html`  
   - Approve Athletes  
   - Approve Entries  
   - Setup Competitions  
3. 🧩 Add FID scoping in UI and data keys.  
4. 🧱 Optional: `/federation/<fid>/index.html` auto page.  

✅ **Output:** Looks/feels like real SaaS with federation separation.

---

## 🏆 L2 — COMPETITION UX POLISH

**Goal:** Clean up competition manager and setup flow.

### Tasks
1. Polish `setup.html` list and filters.  
2. Validate `setup_new.html` inputs (name/date/venue/judges).  
3. Add “Run Console” and “TV Launcher” buttons in control.  
4. Ensure CID links and statuses consistent.  

✅ **Output:** Organizer can create → manage → run events seamlessly.

---

## 🏁 L3 — HEATS MANAGEMENT (LIGHT)

**Goal:** Simplify heat logic for demo reliability.

### Tasks
1. Add heat table UI in `control.html` (heat, athlete, status, score).  
2. Lock heat when all judges submitted (offline logic).  
3. Add “Next Heat” button + broadcast update.  
4. Save to localStorage: `heats_<cid>_<eid>` + tick refresh.  

✅ **Output:** Full end-to-end flow without backend dependency.

---

## 🧍‍♂️ L4 — ATHLETE & FAN FACING PAGES

**Goal:** Add athlete/public perspective for demo completeness.

### Tasks
1. `/athlete/login.html` — stub login and profile view.  
2. `/athlete/results.html` — list entries & scores.  
3. `/public/leaderboard.html` — pull leaderboard_<CID>_<EID>.  
4. Add federation/club logos and light styling.  

✅ **Output:** Multi-persona story: Federation / Athlete / Fan.

---

## 📺 L5 — BROADCAST POLISH

**Goal:** Ensure professional stage look.

### Tasks
1. Finalize `tv_display.html` (intro, scoreboard, leaderboard).  
2. Tune Live1/Live2 switching; add scene preview.  
3. Refine styling, animations, and flag placement.  
4. Verify all fallbacks and blackouts safe.  

✅ **Output:** Ready for live demo broadcast.

---

## ⚙️ L6 — FIRESTORE (THIN SLICE ONLINE)

**Goal:** Cross-device real-time judging (only hot path online).

### Implement Now
- **Judges → Run Console → Reveal → Display**
  - Collection: `judgescores/{cid}/{eid}/{heat}/{jid}`  
  - Aggregate → `results/{cid}/{eid}/{heat}/{aid}`  
  - Publish → `leaderboard/{cid}/{eid}`  
  - Broadcast → Firestore snapshot to displays.

### Scaffold (No Wiring Yet)
- `federations`, `athletes`, `competitions`, `entries`, `rosters`  
- Basic security rules + indexes.

✅ **Output:** Live judging sync across devices, stable offline fallback.

---

## 🎨 L7 — DEMO PACKAGING

**Goal:** Deliver polished SaaS-ready demo.

### Tasks
1. Unified layout (header/footer/colors).  
2. Landing page: `xgames.myqudsyconsultancy.com`.  
3. Buttons: “Login Federation” / “Join as Athlete”.  
4. Seed demo data + prelinked pages.  
5. Deploy via Vercel or Firebase Hosting.  
6. Prepare 1-page PDF architecture summary.  

✅ **Output:** Fully working, production-style SaaS MVP.

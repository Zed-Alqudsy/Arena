## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose & Role
The **Judge Console** is the scoring interface used by individual judges during a live competition heat.  
It allows a judge to:
- Input numeric scores for defined criteria (Difficulty, Execution, Flow, etc.).
- Auto-compute weighted totals.
- Submit (Lock & Submit) a final score for a single athlete in a single heat.
- Emit results into the localStorage broadcast channel (`judge_status` + `judge_status_tick`) for the **Run Console** to ingest in real time.

Each judge‚Äôs tab operates independently but communicates locally through browser storage events.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Functional Breakdown

| Zone | Function | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Mast Header** | Sticky top bar showing Judge ID, Athlete ID/Name, timer | Keeps judge context visible during scoring |
| **Criteria Fields** | Auto-generated numeric inputs (0‚Äì100) for each criterion | Pulled from `scoring_<cid>`; defaults to Difficulty / Execution / Flow |
| **Total Badge** | Large live-updating total | Weighted average preview before submission |
| **Submit Button** | ‚ÄúLock & Submit‚Äù ‚Äî validates, confirms, writes `judge_status` packet | Disables UI after submit |
| **Status Message** | Shows timestamp and submission confirmation | Simple local log |
| **Unload Guard** | Warns if judge tries to close tab before submitting | Browser prompt |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Underlying Logic (Execution Flow)

### 4.1 Parameter Parsing
```js
const p = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
cid  = p.get('cid');
eid  = p.get('eid');
heat = p.get('heat');
jid  = p.get('j');
aid  = p.get('aid');
If any are missing, the page still loads but may show ‚Äú‚Äî‚Äù placeholders.

4.2 Athlete Name Lookup
js
Copy code
athletes_<cid>  ‚Üí  [{ aid, name }]
Resolves aid ‚Üí aname for mast display:

yaml
Copy code
Judge: J1   |   Athlete: Ali ( A1 )
Fallback: displays aid if name not found.

4.3 Scoring Criteria
Reads scoring_<cid> from localStorage.
If missing, builds default:

json
Copy code
{
  "criteria":[
    {"label":"Difficulty","weight":1},
    {"label":"Execution","weight":1},
    {"label":"Flow","weight":1}
  ]
}
For each criterion ‚Üí creates <label> + <input type=number> (0-100 range).
Validation clamps values and recomputes total live.

4.4 Computation
Weighted average:

js
Copy code
total = Œ£(score_i √ó weight_i) / Œ£(weight_i)
Displayed in .total-badge as Total: 99.50.

Live update via input listeners with 0‚Äì100 clamping.

4.5 Submission Workflow
When ‚ÄúLock & Submit‚Äù clicked:

Validate all fields numeric and 0‚Äì100.

Compute final total.

Confirm prompt (confirm() browser).

Construct packet:

json
Copy code
{
  "type":"judge_status",
  "cid":"C1",
  "eid":"E1",
  "heat":"1",
  "judgeId":"J1",
  "athleteId":"A1",
  "scores":{"difficulty":92,"execution":88,"flow":90},
  "total":90.00,
  "status":"locked"
}
Write to:

js
Copy code
localStorage.setItem('judge_status', JSON.stringify(pkt));
localStorage.setItem('judge_status_tick', String(Date.now()));
Disable all fields + button (lockUI());
stop timer; show Submitted at HH:MM:SS.

4.6 Cross-Tab Integration
The Run Console (in another tab) listens for:

judge_status ‚Üí ingest packet into scores_<CID>_<EID>_<HEAT>

judge_status_tick ‚Üí refresh table / update log

No direct fetch or network calls; purely localStorage based real-time bus.

4.7 Timer
Starts on load ‚Üí updates every 250 ms.
Simple stopwatch to indicate active scoring session.

4.8 Unload Guard
Before unload:

js
Copy code
if (!submitted) { e.preventDefault(); e.returnValue = ''; }
Prevents accidental tab closure before submit.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Contracts Observed
Key	Purpose	R/W	Source Module
athletes_<cid>	Roster for name lookup	Read	Federation / Competition Setup
scoring_<cid>	Criteria labels + weights	Read	Setup-New
judge_status	Judge packet broadcast	Write	Judge Console
judge_status_tick	Timestamp signal for Run Console	Write	Judge Console

6Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Flow (Summary)
Judge opens URL with cid/eid/heat/j/aid.

Page builds criteria inputs from scoring_<cid>.

Judge enters scores (0‚Äì100); Total badge updates live.

Click Lock & Submit ‚Üí confirm ‚Üí emit judge_status.

UI locks; timestamp displayed; Run Console detects and updates heat table.

Tab safe to close.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Status Checklist
Component	Status	Notes
Criteria auto-load	‚úÖ	Fully dynamic
Weighted compute	‚úÖ	Live preview
Submission emit	‚úÖ	LocalStorage packet
Timer display	‚úÖ	Real-time
Validation	‚úÖ	0‚Äì100 range check
Lock after submit	‚úÖ	UI disabled
Cross-tab signal	‚úÖ	Via judge_status_tick
Network sync	‚ùå	None (local-only)
Error recovery	‚öôÔ∏è	Relies on browser storage
Auth guard	‚ùå	Open URL access

8Ô∏è‚É£ Gaps / Risks
No authentication ‚Üí anyone with URL can submit scores.

Single write channel ‚Üí later judge overwrites same judge_status.

No confirmation back-channel ‚Üí judge does not know if Run Console received packet.

No auto-retry on storage collision.

Criteria inconsistency possible if scoring_<cid> modified mid-heat.

9Ô∏è‚É£ QA Checklist (Local Test)
Set up in console:

js
Copy code
localStorage.setItem('scoring_C1', JSON.stringify({
  criteria:[{label:'Difficulty',weight:1},{label:'Execution',weight:1},{label:'Flow',weight:1}]
}));
localStorage.setItem('athletes_C1', JSON.stringify([{aid:'A1',name:'Ali'}]));
Open judge.html?cid=C1&eid=E1&heat=1&j=J1&aid=A1.

Enter scores 90/85/92 ‚Üí Total = 89.00.

Click Lock & Submit ‚Üí confirm.

Verify in console:

js
Copy code
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('judge_status'))
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('judge_status_tick'))
Run Console should ingest and display A1 score.

Reload judge tab ‚Üí fields locked and timestamp shown.

üîü Traceability Register
Function	Purpose	Keys Affected
computeTotal()	Weighted score calc	‚Äî
refreshTotal()	UI update	‚Äî
lockUI()	Disable inputs + timer stop	‚Äî
btn.onclick()	Validate + emit packet	judge_status, judge_status_tick
beforeunload handler	Safety prompt	‚Äî

‚úÖ Conclusion
The Judge Console is a self-contained, offline-ready scoring terminal.
It reliably generates and transmits a normalized judge_status packet used by the Run Console.
While lightweight and responsive, it depends entirely on localStorage integrity and lacks access control ‚Äî suitable for prototype or controlled LAN deployments.

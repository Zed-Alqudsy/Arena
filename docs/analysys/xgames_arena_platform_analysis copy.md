# 🧭 XGAMES ARENA PLATFORM ANALYSIS

## **Batch 1 — Competition Module Analysis (Phase 1: System Audit)**

### 🧩 Overview
The current uploaded files represent the Competition Management Core of the XGAMES ARENA SaaS ecosystem. They define the foundation for how federations, clubs, and organizers will handle competition creation, setup, listing, and run operations. The logic is offline-first using localStorage and shared core JS utilities.

### 🧠 Core System Architecture Snapshot
| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Storage** | LocalStorage-based via `State.keys.*` and helper functions. |
| **Logic Modules** | `/shared/core.js`, `/shared/state.js`, `/shared/ui.js`, `/shared/lang.js` handle URL routing, toast messaging, state storage, and localization. |
| **UI Theme** | Consistent card-based interface with modern gradients and responsive design. |
| **Routing** | URL query string + `Core.buildUrl()` navigation. |
| **Mode** | Offline prototype, Firestore-ready. |

| Public / Fan View | ❌ Missing | Planned module. |
| Analytics / Broadcast | ❌ Missing | Future expansion. |

## **Batch 2 – Run Console Analysis (Phase 1 Extended Audit)**

### 🔹 Purpose
This file (`run_console.html`) is the **operational nerve center** of your competition system. It handles live event execution — linking judges, managing heats, syncing scores, publishing leaderboards, and controlling TV displays — all through localStorage and the shared JS core (`core.js`, `state.js`, `ui.js`, `sync_local.js`).

---

### 🧩 Functional Breakdown
| Zone | Function | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Header** | Navigation + Context | Displays CID / EID / Heat; back-button; live status badge. |
| **Status Card** | Live Heat Overview | Shows number of athletes / judges + current heat status. |
| **Judge Links** | Auto-generated URLs | Creates individual judge URLs (`/pages/judge.html`) with query params (`cid`, `eid`, `heat`, `j`). |
| **Run Controls** | Core Action Panel | Buttons for **Start / Lock / Reveal / Undo**, athlete selection, and manual score entry. |
| **Display Centre** | Broadcast Control | Manages TV screens (live1/live2): Intro / Scoreboard / Leaderboard / Hide modes + auto-status sync. |
| **Scores Monitor** | Live Score Table | Displays per-judge totals, timestamps, and computed “Final” score with weighted criteria. |
| **Event Log** | Persistent Audit | Logs all key events (`START`, `LOCK`, `REVEAL`, etc.) with timestamp and athlete name mapping. |

---

### 🧠 Underlying Code Structure

#### 1️⃣ Core Helpers
```js
const LS = { get(key, fb), set(key, val), remove(key) };
const k = { athletes, judges, heats, scores, active, leaderboard, rules, display(screen) };
const el = id => document.getElementById(id);
const now = () => new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
```
> Provides unified access to all per-competition stores like `scores_<cid>_<eid>_<heat>` or `display_control_live1`.

#### 2️⃣ Initialization & State Binding
- Reads URL params via `Core.requireParams(['cid','eid','heat'])`.
- Hydrates athlete and judge lists from `State.keys.*`.
- Displays counts, builds athlete dropdown, and sets current heat status.

#### 3️⃣ Judge Link Generator
Dynamically produces five judge URLs (J1–J5) with encoded CID/EID/HEAT/AID — enabling multi-tab or multi-device scoring screens.

#### 4️⃣ Manual Score System
```js
store.results.push({ jid, aid, total, time });
LS.set(k.scores, store);
refreshScoresTable();
```
Recalculates final averages in real time with optional **“drop extremes”** rule.

#### 5️⃣ Leaderboard & Reveal Logic
Key internal functions:
- `publishReveal()` — computes per-athlete final using judge totals → writes `reveal` and `reveal_tick` keys.
- `publishLeaderboard()` — aggregates all `scores_<cid>_<eid>_<heat>` → ranks → writes `leaderboard_<cid>_<eid>` and tick key.
- Weighted averaging from `scoring_<cid>` criteria, supporting variable judging schemes.

#### 6️⃣ Display Control System
```js
setDisplay(mode);
LS.set(k.display(screen), mode);
```
Tracks current TV output mode (`intro`, `scoreboard`, `leaderboard`, `hide`) per screen; auto-updates status indicators.

#### 7️⃣ Sync & Storage Listeners
- Real-time refresh via `window.addEventListener('storage')` for cross-tab sync.  
- Integrates `SyncLocal.on()` for future live network sync (FireStore/websocket ready).  
- Ingests `judge_status` packets → updates score arrays + refresh UI.

#### 8️⃣ Event Recovery Mechanisms
- Restores active heat if found in `localStorage.active_heat`.  
- Reloads previous event log per heat (`eventlog_<cid>_<eid>_<heat>`).  
- Remembers last selected athlete per heat (`ui_sel_ath_<CID>_<EID>_<HEAT>`).

---

### 🧩 Data Contracts
| Key | Purpose | Structure |
|-----|----------|------------|
| `scores_<cid>_<eid>_<heat>` | All judge scores for a heat | `{results:[{jid,aid,total,time}]}` |
| `heats_<cid>_<eid>` | Heat definitions & status | `{heats:[{heatId,status}]}` |
| `leaderboard_<cid>_<eid>` | Ranked results | `{rows:[{rank,aid,final}]}` |
| `display_control_live1/2` | Display modes for TV | `"intro" / "scoreboard" / "leaderboard" / "hide"` |
| `rules` | Drop-extremes config | `{dropExtremes:true|false}` |
| `reveal` | Last revealed packet | `{cid,eid,heat,aid,judgeTotals,final}` |

---

### 📊 Execution Flow
1️⃣ **Setup & Init** → load state, map athletes/judges.  
2️⃣ **Start Heat** → status → “Running”.  
3️⃣ **Judges Submit Scores** → storage event trigger.  
4️⃣ **RefreshScoresTable()** → update table + final calc.  
5️⃣ **Lock Heat** → disable inputs.  
6️⃣ **Reveal → Publish Leaderboard** → broadcast update.  
7️⃣ **TV Display auto-refresh** via `leaderboard_tick`.  
8️⃣ **Undo/Recovery** → clears `reveal`, reloads event log.

---

### 🔒 Strengths
- Fully functional offline runner.  
- Modular, Firestore-ready data keys.  
- Robust recovery & event logging.  
- TV broadcast control and multi-judge design already wired.  

### ⚠️ Gaps
| Area | Status | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Real-time multi-judge sync | ⚙️ Partial | Relies on storage events / SyncLocal; needs backend bridge. |
| Criteria weight management | ⚙️ Partial | Reads from `scoring_<cid>` but lacks UI editor. |
| User auth / role security | ❌ Missing | No federation/judge login yet. |
| Cloud storage integration | ❌ Missing | Still offline prototype. |
| Analytics & report exports | ❌ Missing | No PDF/CSV yet. |

---

### 🧩 Next Step
Continue to next module (e.g., **Judge UI**, **Leaderboard Page**, **Display Control**) for deeper system mapping. Each addition will extend this Canvas as the living master technical audit document.

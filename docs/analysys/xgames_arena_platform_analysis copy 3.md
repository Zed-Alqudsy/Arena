## **Batch 4 — Results & Broadcast System Audit**

### 🧩 Overview
This batch finalizes the competition cycle by auditing the **TV display and scoreboard broadcast modules**, completing the offline pipeline from Run Console → Reveal → Leaderboard → Display.

---

### **1️⃣ TV Display**
**File:** `tv_display.html`【70†tv_display.html】

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Main TV broadcast page controlling 3 display modes: **Intro / Scoreboard / Leaderboard**. |
| **UI Zones** | `#view-intro`, `#view-scoreboard`, `#view-leaderboard`, plus blackout overlay and LIVE 1/2 tag. |
| **Mode Logic** | Reads `display_control_live1 / display_control_live2` to determine display mode (`intro`, `scoreboard`, `leaderboard`, `hide`). |
| **Intro Mode** | Displays athlete media (image/video) + metadata (name, flag, country, event). Pulls data from `reveal` and `athletes_<cid>`. |
| **Scoreboard Mode** | Shows judge scores (J1–J5) and computed final score from `reveal`. |
| **Leaderboard Mode** | Loads rankings from `leaderboard_<cid>_<eid>`; maps athlete IDs to names. |
| **Sync Mechanism** | Reacts to `storage` events → keys: `display_control_*`, `reveal`, `leaderboard_*`, `leaderboard_tick`. |
| **Fallbacks** | Defaults to scoreboard if mode or data missing. |
| **Status** | ✅ Fully functional for dual-screen offline operation. |
| **Next** | Implement `SyncLocal` hooks for remote updates and automatic rotation between modes. |

---

### **2️⃣ TV Scoreboard**
**File:** `tv_scoreboard.html`【71†tv_scoreboard.html】

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Lightweight scoreboard variant for single-screen display setups. |
| **UI Layout** | Athlete header with flag + name; five judge cards; total score footer. |
| **Reveal Integration** | Auto-updates from `reveal` data structure `{cid,eid,heat,aid,judgeTotals[],final}`. |
| **Mode Control** | Tied to `display_control_live1/2`; blackout if inactive. |
| **Event Listener** | `window.addEventListener('storage', ...)` for live updates on `reveal`. |
| **Status** | ✅ Production-stable lightweight alternative. |
| **Next** | Merge into unified display controller or maintain as fallback version. |

---

### 🧠 **Broadcast System Logic Map**
| Component | Triggers | Reads | Writes | Purpose |
|------------|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| Run Console | User triggers Reveal/Publish | Scores | `reveal`, `leaderboard_*`, `leaderboard_tick`, `display_control_*` | Pushes updates to displays |
| TV Display | `storage` event or mode change | `reveal`, `display_control_*`, `leaderboard_*` | UI updates only | Main broadcast screen |
| TV Scoreboard | `storage` change on `reveal` | `reveal` | UI updates only | Single-screen scoreboard |

---

### 🧩 **Data Contracts Recap**
| Key | Structure | Usage |
|------|------------|--------|
| `display_control_live1/2` | `"intro" / "scoreboard" / "leaderboard" / "hide"` | Controls active TV mode |
| `reveal` | `{cid,eid,heat,aid,judgeTotals[],final}` | Broadcast feed for scores + intro |
| `leaderboard_<cid>_<eid>` | `{rows:[{rank,aid,final}]}` | Leaderboard rendering |
| `leaderboard_tick` | timestamp string | Forces display refresh |

---

### 🧱 **System Completeness Snapshot After Batch 4**
| Area | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Competition Setup → Run → Broadcast | ✅ Full offline end-to-end pipeline operational |
| Multi-screen control | ✅ Independent LIVE 1 & LIVE 2 control confirmed |
| Athlete media integration | ⚙️ Partial (static or hardcoded asset path) |
| Leaderboard | ✅ Auto-refresh via tick key |
| Cloud sync | ❌ Pending (`SyncLocal` / Firestore required) |
| UI theming | ✅ Unified dark mode TV design |
| Automation bridge | ⚙️ Partial – Run Console triggers manual updates only |

---

### ✅ **Conclusion (Phase 1 Completed System)**
With Batch 4, the **XGAMES ARENA local-first competition management system** now covers the **entire operational pipeline:**
- Athlete registration
- Federation approval
- Competition setup
- Event and heat management
- Live judging and scoring
- Leaderboard reveal and multi-screen broadcast

Next step: Begin **Phase 2 — Cloud Integration and Multi-User Architecture Audit** to map Firestore, authentication layers, and federation multi-club hierarchy for SaaS readiness.

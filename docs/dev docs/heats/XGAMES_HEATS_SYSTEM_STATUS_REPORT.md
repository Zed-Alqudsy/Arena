# XGAMES HEATS SYSTEM — Status & Handover Report  
_Date: 2025-10-30 04:28:59_  

---

## 🔧 Phase Context
This document summarizes the full execution status for the **XGAMES Heats System (Firestore-Ready)** as completed in this thread.  
It acts as a **handover record** for continuation in the next thread.

---

## 🧭 Objective
To build the complete **Heats System** (offline-first, Firestore-ready) connecting:
- Competition setup → Heats generation → Running heats → Publishing → Stage advancement

## 🧩 Ladder Step Progress

| Step | Description | Status | Notes |
|------|--------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Environment load, confirm file structure (from `full_tree.txt`) | ✅ Done | All files confirmed to be directly under `/pages/`, no subfolders |
| 2 | Verify shared dependencies (`core.js`, `state.js`, `ui.js`, `lang.js`) | ✅ Done | Globals confirmed working; red lines are editor warnings only |
| 3 | Load `competition_home.html` and fix incorrect tab target (`id="events"`) | ✅ Done | Corrected misplaced ID causing unclickable tab |
| 4 | Establish “Open Event Admin” button logic | ✅ Done | Added runtime link builder using `cid` and first `eid` |
| 5 | Diagnose blocked clicks (overlay due to unbalanced divs) | ✅ Done | Fixed by cleaning layout nesting |
| 6 | Analyze “Heats” card premature display | ✅ Done | Root cause: empty heats shell created by `setup_new.html` |
| 7 | Design decision: hide “Heats” card until real heats exist | ✅ Approved & Implemented | Logic updated to show card only when `heats[].length > 0` |
| 8 | Remove direct “Open Run Console” shortcut | ✅ Done | Enforced rule: run console should only open from Event Admin |
| 9 | Validate page runtime | ✅ Verified | All UI, tab links, and dynamic counters working correctly |
| 10 | Confirm Ladder continuation plan | ✅ Done | Next stage = Event Admin / Heats Composer build |

---

## 🧱 Current Competition Home Logic
- Reads `cid` from query.
- Loads competition details from `competitions_active` in `localStorage`.
- Displays summary counts: Events / Athletes / Judges.
- “Go to Event Admin” opens the first event if any exist.
- “Events & Heats” card **now hidden** unless `heats[].length > 0`.
- All “Run Heat” buttons now disabled until actual heats exist.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Summary

### ✅ Fixes Applied
1. Corrected misplaced `id="events"` to proper section.
2. Repaired DOM structure to prevent click-blocking overlays.
3. Added button linking to first event admin dynamically.
4. Added conditional rendering for heats list.
5. Removed premature “Run Heat” and “Run Console” links.
6. Confirmed functional navigation and tab anchors.

### ⚠️ Pending / Next
- Event Admin upgrade: add full Heats creation logic (Stage → Heat → Player assignment).
- Heat Composer page: allow qualification/final structure per setup.
- Firestore linkage: sync `heats_<CID>_<EID>` and leaderboard docs on save.

## 🪜 Ladder Continuation Plan

| Next Step | Task | Output |
|------------|------|--------|
| Step 3 → 4 (Next Thread) | Event Admin Page Integration | `event_admin.html` verified and upgraded |
| Step 4 → 5 | Heats Overview / Composer | new `heats_composer.html` page |
| Step 5 → 6 | Heat Select and Run Console sync | confirm run flow with live data |
| Step 7 → 8 | Publish results → Leaderboard auto-fill | `leaderboard_<CID>_<EID>` generation |
| Step 9 | Full Firestore sync | mirror local data structure |
| Step 10 | Final QA, offline/online parity | QC + Firestore verification |

---

## 🧾 Notes for Next Thread
- All actions so far are localStorage-based.
- `competition_home.html` is now stable and UI-ready.
- Next thread begins from **Event Admin Build Phase**.
- Continue **strict step-by-step execution** (assistant leads, user executes).
- Reuse the same CID context already confirmed in localStorage.
- Maintain naming schema: `heats_<CID>_<EID>`, `scores_<CID>_<EID>_<HEAT>`, `leaderboard_<CID>_<EID>`.

## ✅ Current System State Summary

| Component | State | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Competition Home | ✅ Clean | Working, no phantom heats |
| Event Admin | ⚙️ Next | To handle heats and player mapping |
| Setup / Setup New | ✅ Functional | Creates competition shell correctly |
| Heat Select | ⚙️ Pending | To be linked after Event Admin logic |
| Run Console | ⚙️ Pending | Works but awaits real heat data |
| Shared Core (JS) | ✅ Stable | Fully functional |

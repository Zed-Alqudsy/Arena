✅ [XGAMES PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT — PHASE B COMPLETE REPORT]

🎯 Phase B Objective

Goal: Link the Preset & Parameter Foundation (Phase A) to the Competition Setup Form, making presets dynamically pre-fill judging, runs, and round parameters — editable by organizers and saved into the model for downstream modules.

Primary File: /modules/competition/setup_new.html
Supporting JS: core.js, state.js, ui.js, presets.js, preset_adapter.js
Reference Doc: Skateboarding Competition Formats – Comparison Table.docx

🧩 Implemented Components
B1 – Competition & Event Save Logic (Verification)

Confirmed Approve & Activate writes correct keys:

competitions_active, events_<CID>, judges_<CID>, heatsTemplate_<CID>, athletes_<CID>

Ensured activation flow not broken after schema extension.

Preset snapshot now propagates into model.preset before save.

B2 – Editable Numeric Fields (Competition Parameters)

Added directly below Schedule & Venue:

Runs per Athlete (p_runsPerAthlete)

Tricks per Round (p_tricksPerRound)

Advancement Rule (Top N) (p_advancementTopN)
These accept organizer overrides to preset defaults.

B3 – Validation Logic

Added lightweight validator to prevent invalid values:

Minimum 1 run / 1 advancement.

Non-negative tricks.

Soft warning if < 2 runs.
Triggered automatically on “Approve & Activate.”

B4 – Competition Summary (Live Preview)

Display-only table showing current preset snapshot:

Discipline / Rounds / Runs / Tricks / Runtime / Judges / Scoring / Advancement

Auto-updates via presetChanged event and DOMContentLoaded.

⚙️ Integration Fixes & Enhancements

Preset Mapper Bridge: Implemented localStorage snapshot (preset_snapshot_<CID>) → auto-loaded into model.preset.

Phase C2 Script: Added auto-fill + editable binding — fields populate from preset and update model.preset on change.

Validation Hook: Ensures parameters saved safely with event metadata.

UI Consistency: Preserved existing layout and activation buttons without shifting design.

🧠 Behavioral Verification
Test Case	Expected Result	Status
Select preset in mapper → Save & Return	Form & Summary auto-filled	✅ Pass
Edit parameters manually	Updates model.preset on change	✅ Pass
Approve & Activate	Saves merged preset into events_<CID>	✅ Pass
Old competition (no preset)	Loads blank → mapper can attach snapshot	✅ Pass
Validation edge cases	Blocks 0 or negative inputs	✅ Pass
📦 Outputs & Artifacts
File	Change Summary
setup_new.html	Added Competition Parameters, Summary, Preset auto-fill, validation, snapshot loader
preset_mapper.html	Existing logic validated (saves preset_snapshot_<CID>)
presets.js / preset_adapter.js	No modification; verified API consistency
core.js, state.js, ui.js	Used as-is; compatible
🔄 Next Phase (Soon)

Phase C — Event Admin Integration

Auto-apply preset values when composing heats/events.

Reflect parameters in Event Admin UI and Run Console.

Prepare Preset.applyToEvent() adapter for Firestore-ready handoff.

✅ Summary

Phase B — Form Parameter Mapping: COMPLETE

✔ Preset selection → localStorage snapshot
✔ Auto-load into setup form & model
✔ Editable numeric parameters with validation
✔ Summary preview reflects live values
✔ Activation flow intact and safe

System Status: Stable ✓ Ready for Phase C (Event Admin sync).

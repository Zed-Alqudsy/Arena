# Phase D Implementation Loop #1 Report

## ✅ Completed Tickets (D1–D10)
- **D1 — Heat Select listing**: Heat cards now read from the stored heat shell, display round labels, normalized status text, and link by heat ID to support the updated Run Console routing.
- **D2 — Variable run support**: Run Console exposes a per-heat run counter with navigation controls, stores per-run progress, and shows current run context across status badges and score tracking.
- **D3 — Preset scoring model ingest**: Heat configuration (runs, tricks, judging scale, drop-high/low, advancement, judges) hydrates from the preset snapshot/heat record and seeds UI badges automatically.
- **D4 — Scoring computation**: Manual and judge-sourced scores apply per-run averaging with preset-aware drop-extreme rules; standings aggregate best totals according to the configured scoring format.
- **D5 — Advancement marking**: Standings table ranks athletes, highlights Top N advancers, and persists the advancement list back into the heat snapshot.
- **D6 — Leaderboard/publish flow**: Leaderboard publishing now consumes the live standings snapshot, writing preset-aligned finals to `leaderboard_<cid>_<eid>` for offline/TV sync.
- **D7 — Judges attached to heats**: Event Admin copies the prepared judge roles into each heat’s `judgesPanel` and Run Console prefers that panel when building judge links and counts.
- **D8 — Athlete slot seeding**: Heats auto-seed slot lanes from the event roster (with preset/default sizing) when created or when seeding is triggered, ensuring Run Console order and standings alignment.
- **D9 — Judges mismatch indicator**: Run Console surfaces a non-blocking warning when preset and stored judge counts diverge (preserved from prior work but now using the new config pipeline).
- **D10 — Preset-driven scoring flow**: Drop-high/low, judge count, runs/tricks, advancement, and judging scale all originate from the preset snapshot/heat record and persist with each heat update.

## 🔄 Persistence & State
- Heat progress (current run, per-run finals, advancement list) saves to `heat_progress_<cid>_<eid>_<heat>` and back into `heats_<cid>_<eid>`.
- Standings auto-refresh after reveals and leaderboard publishes to keep advancers in sync for TVs/offline flows.

## 🧪 Validation Notes
- Manual scoring + reveal flow exercised locally to confirm per-run aggregation, run counter updates, standings, and leaderboard writes operate against preset-configured parameters.
- Event Admin “Prepare Judges” and “Add Heat” flows tested to verify judge panel attachment and slot seeding without touching unrelated modules.

## 📌 Follow-ups
- TV display surfaces still show finals per athlete; future loops can surface the active run indicator if required.
- Additional automation around progressing to the next run remains manual by design for this loop.

## 🪜 L8 — Main Implementation Steps

### 1. Athlete Registration
- Finalized register.html submission logic.
- Ensured NSID auto-generation format: NSID-<FID>-<YYYY>-<00001>.
- Validated required fields and de-dupe logic.
- Data stored in athletes_staging for federation approval.

### 2. Federation Approval Page
- Tabbed interface for Pending / Approved / Rejected.
- Implemented approve/reject actions.
- Added federation filter logic (FID-based).
- Verified all counters and rendering refresh.

### 3. Federation Filter Fix
- Added FID dropdown reload logic:
```js
const fidSel = document.getElementById('fidFilter');
if (fidSel) fidSel.addEventListener('change', loadAll);
```

### 4. Data Verification
- Seeded athletes manually.
- Confirmed transitions from staging → master.

## ⚙️ Pre-L9 Enhancement — Competition Setup Search
Added a live search bar for setup.html to filter competitions by name or CID.

### Code Changes
```js
const qEl = document.getElementById('searchText');
const q = qEl ? String(qEl.value || '').toLowerCase() : '';
if (q) {
  out = out.filter(x =>
    String(x.name || '').toLowerCase().includes(q) ||
    String(x.cid || '').toLowerCase().includes(q)
  );
}
```
And live listener:
```js
const q = document.getElementById('searchText');
if (q) q.addEventListener('input', () => {
  const data = applyFilterSort(all);
  renderList(data);
});
```

### Result
- Instant search across competition name/CID.
- Works with filter + sort controls.

---

## 🔗 Outcome
✅ Athlete registration & approval complete.  
✅ Federation filter works.  
✅ Competition setup search functional.  
Ready to proceed with L9 Athlete → Competition Linking.

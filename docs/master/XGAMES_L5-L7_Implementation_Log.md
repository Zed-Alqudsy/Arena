## 🧩 System Files Involved
| Type | Path |
|:--|:--|
| Shared Logic | `/shared/core.js`, `/shared/state.js`, `/shared/ui.js`, `/shared/lang.js` |
| Athlete UI | `/modules/athlete/join.html` |
| Federation UI | `/modules/federation/approve_entries.html` |
| Federation Data | `localStorage.athletes_master`, `entries_staging_<CID>`, `athletes_<CID>`, `athletes_aid_cursor_<CID>` |

## ⚙️ Process Summary

### **L5 – Athlete Join**
- Page: `/modules/athlete/join.html?cid=<CID>`
- Athlete inputs NSID, category, and note.
- Validation:
  - NSID must exist in `athletes_master`.
  - Category required.
  - Prevents duplicate entries.
- Writes to:
  ```
  entries_staging_<CID> = [{ nsid, category, note, createdAt }]
  ```
- Increments:
  ```
  athletes_tick_<CID>
  ```
- Output confirmed in console ✅

### **L6 – Federation Review**
- Page: `/modules/federation/approve_entries.html?cid=<CID>`
- Reads from:
  ```
  athletes_master
  entries_staging_<CID>
  ```
- Admin can:
  - Add by NSID (manual input)
  - Search/filter athletes_master
  - Approve or remove entries
- Uses same shared JS paths `/shared/...` (absolute root).

### **L7 – Publish (Approve → Official Roster)**
- Each approval assigns sequential **AID**:
  ```
  A1, A2, A3, ...
  ```
- Cursor stored in:
  ```
  athletes_aid_cursor_<CID>
  ```
- Writes roster to:
  ```
  athletes_<CID> = [{
    aid, nsid, name, nation, state, district, sex, club, category
  }]
  ```
- Excludes `national_id` permanently ✅  
- Removes approved entries from staging ✅  
- Increments tick:
  ```
  athletes_tick_<CID>
  ```

## 🧾 Final Test Results

| Test | Result |
|:--|:--|
| Submit athlete join | ✅ `{ nsid:'NSID-MSF-2025-00001', category:'Street Open Men', … }` |
| Approve 1st athlete | ✅ `A1` created, staging cleared |
| Seed new athlete | ✅ `NSID-MSF-2025-00002` added to master |
| Join & approve 2nd athlete | ✅ `A2` created, cursor=2 |
| Privacy check | ✅ No `national_id` in published roster |
| Data persistence | ✅ Survives reloads (localStorage stable) |

## 📦 Resulting LocalStorage Keys (CID_GJL6A2)
| Key | Status | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `athletes_master` | ✅ 2 athletes registered |
| `entries_staging_CID_GJL6A2` | ✅ empty |
| `athletes_CID_GJL6A2` | ✅ 2 entries (A1, A2) |
| `athletes_aid_cursor_CID_GJL6A2` | ✅ “2” |
| `athletes_tick_CID_GJL6A2` | ✅ updated timestamp |

---

## 🔐 Compliance
- Fully adheres to **NSID / AID / CID** contracts from Playbook.  
- Follows privacy rule: `national_id` never leaves federation scope.  
- Maintains schema required by RUN & TV display pages.  
- Non-breaking with all existing federation/athlete logic.
